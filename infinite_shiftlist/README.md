# infinite_shiftlist

Infinite Shiftlist is a modification of rmparry7's infinite_playlist which includes pitch and tempo shifting between sections and moves the comparisons from beat level to section level.

The module is executed by providing the folder of mp3 files in your directory, or by typing 'spotify' as an argument if you want to pull songs from Spotify, like so:

```
python infinite_shiftlist.py BachFugues
# or
python infinite_shiftlist.py spotify
```
